        Evan Bowman was born in Fairfax, Virginia in 1995, and grew up in Albany
        New York. Although he works professionally as an engineer, writing
        low-level systems software, Evan has a lifelong interest in color and
        design. His earliest artistic influence came from his mother, a graphic
        designer and painter. He continued his art education in high school,
        where his drawing teacher encouraged him to pursue a career in
        illustration, but Evan decided to study engineering instead, thus ending
        his formal art education. He has a degree in computer engineering from
        Boston University, and has lived in the Boston area since late 2013.
      </p>

      <p>
        Once a practical engineer, largely uninterested in abstract mathematical
        theory, Evan ultimately became bored with certain aspects of software
        development, finding them insufficently challenging, and now spends much
        of his time outside of work playing with recursive algorithms in LISP
        interpreters, and programming Gameboy consoles in C++, and in ARM and
        Z80 assembly languages.
      </p>

      <p>
        In his choice of artistic subjects, Evan finds inspiration in the
        landscape of the Northeastern United States, where he grew up. He
        especially admires the work of printmaker Felix Vallotton, as well as
        hundreds of other artists, particulary from the baroque era, Les Nabis,
        realism, and nineteenth century art more generally.
      </p>

      <p>
        Evan works obsessively on his paintings, but has never exhibited or sold
        anything or had much recognition. He became increasingly reclusive
        during the 2020 pandemic, and lives under a growing, cluttered pile of
        his prints and sketches. He maintains a painting studio near Boston,
        where he has crammed some cabinets, easels, and a large etching press,
        into a spare bedroom of his apartment.
