        Evan Bowman was born in Fairfax, Virginia in 1995, and grew up in
        Albany, New York. Although he works professionally as an engineer, Evan
        has a lifelong interest in color and design. He works obsessively on his
        paintings, but has never exhibited or sold anything or had much
        recognition. While he mainly works in oil paint and gouache, he began
        using gouache in middle school at the urging of his mother, who works as
        a graphic designer, and he is happiest when sketching with gouache paint.
