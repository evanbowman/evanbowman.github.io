        Evan Bowman was born in Fairfax, Virginia in 1995, and grew up
        in upstate New York. His earliest artistic influence came from
        his mother, a graphic designer and painter. He continued his
        art education in high school, where his drawing teacher
        encouraged him to pursue a career in illustration, but Evan
        decided to study biomedical engineering instead, thus ending
        his formal art education.
      </p>

      <p>
        He went on to attend Boston University, where he changed
        majors, and graduated with a B.S. in computer
        engineering. Evan got back into visual art during college,
        making pixel-art animations for some computer games that he
        was developing in his spare time.
      </p>

      <p>
        After completing his studies, he started a career with a
        brokerage, writing low latency code for high frequency trading
        applications. Spending significant time at work dealing with
        computers, Evan redeveloped an interest in traditional easel
        painting. He began to refine his painting technique in the
        evenings after work, by making careful copies of baroque
        masterworks and impressionist paintings.
      </p>

      <p>
        Evan chooses his painting subjects from his life and
        surroundings, preferring to paint small still lifes, self
        portraits and portraits of family members, and plein air
        studies near his home in the Northeast United States.
