Of course, what works for one person often doesn't work for another, so if you have a different method that works for you, then that's great too. </p> <p> I prefer to use transparent pigments throughout the majority of my paintings. The natural world is full of grays, and transparent paints excel at producing clean gray tints. I like to have both a stronger and a weaker transparent yellow on hand, for example; Indian Yellow paired with Raw Sienna. In the color chart below, I've included my favorite three weak yellows on the left, and my favorite three strong yellows on the right. </p> <p> I've avoided opaque yellows in the past, because when used excessively, I think that bright opaque yellows can make a painting look immature. While I admire loosely painted impressionest works, with their pure passages of chrome yellows, my own style tends toward a tighter, more linear means of expression. I think that use of bright yellows and reds in a hard-edged linear painting makes the result look like a glossy magazine illustration, so I tend to favor earthier pigments. <p> <p> But I admit, sometimes you still need an opaque yellow. Yellow Ocher Pale (PY42, sometimes also called Mars Yellow) works well, and one can achieve some stronger semi-opaque yellows by mixing a little Indian Yellow or Green Gold into the pale ocher. Recently, I also started using Nickel Titanate Yellow, a nice bright desaturated lemon yellow, sort of similar to Lead Tin Lemon Yellow employed by the baroque masters. </p> <p> </p> <img src=img/blog/transparent_yellows.png class=post-image-large> <p> Pictured above, from left to right: </p> <li>Michael Harding French Yellow Ocher</li> <li>Winsor Newton (W & N) Raw Sienna</li> <li>W & N Tranparent Gold Ocher</li> <li>W & N Indian Yellow</li> <li>W & N Indian Yellow Deep</li> <li>W & N Green Gold.</li> <div><u class=load-comments id=7></u><div class=comments></div></div><div class=separator></div> </div> </div> <!-- <script src="js/blogcomment.js"></script> --> </html>
