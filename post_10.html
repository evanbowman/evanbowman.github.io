I began using Prussian blue gouache within the last few years, mostly for practical reasons; prussian blue dries quite dark for a gouache paint, but also for subjective reasons; I like the gloomy character and personality of the paint, as well as the naturalistic greens mixed from prussian blue and yellow ocher. </p> <p> I knew, years before I started using Prussian blue, about the paint's rumored marginal lightfastness, but I never knew how dramatically the paint changes when exposed to direct sunlight. This summer, I accidentally left a small sketch on my sun-drenched dining room table for a week, with most of the painting covered by a stack of papers, only to find that the blue in the exposed area of the painting had almost entirely bleached out after a single week of exposure. </p> <p> I had remembered reading an article in a scientific journal, where the authors had noted that much of the intensity of sun-bleached prussian blue could be restored by leaving a painting in a dark room for a while, so I threw the sketch in a closet and forgot about it for a couple of months. </p> <p> At the end of the summer, I opened my coat closet, collected my forgotten sketch, and was surprised to find all of the color restored. </p> <p> Ultimately, I plan to keep using Prussian blue, despite lightfastness concerns, as even severe light damage from direct sunlight seems to be reversible. </p> <img src=img/blog/pb_sun_bleached.jpg class=post-image-large> <p class=label>Fragment of gouache sketch, sun bleached edge</p> <img src=img/blog/pb_restored.jpg class=post-image-large> <p class=label>Fragment of gouache sketch, color restored after two months of total darkness</p> <p> Inevitably, as I took the above photos months apart, you'll notice different ambient lighting/saturation in the two pictures. But, importantly, you can clearly see the restored color in the exposed area. While Prussian blue restoration in dark rooms may be common knowledge among art conservators, I wanted to share this info, as I happened upon a particulary extreme example of sun bleaching followed by nearly total color recovery, and people may not know that severe cases of what may at first appear to be UV damage are in fact mostly reversible. </p> <div><u class=load-comments id=10></u><div class=comments></div></div><div class=separator></div> </div> </div> <!-- <script src="js/blogcomment.js"></script> --> </html>
