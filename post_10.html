An undiscerning reader, presented with those search results, could be forgiven for concluding that zinc white is actually harmful to the integrity of oil paint films. But when one actually considers the testing methods in each of those articles, and compares said methods to the environmental effects and mechanical forces <i>that are actually likely to be experienced by an oil painting</i>, one is left wondering whether these articles offer any relevant and useful information whatsoever. </p> <p> Furthermore, a number of sources critical of Zinc white, including Natural Pigments and Golden Artist Colors, are actively engaged in marketing and selling flake white, a lead-based paint, and the only other popular white paint, besides zinc, that mixes clean tints with opaque colors. I, on the other hand, have no possible financial motive of any kind for recommending one paint over another, and would like to offer another perspective to this whole debate. </p> <p> Let us start by considering the article, "Zinc White: Problems in Oil Paint," on the Natural Pigments website. The whole basis of the natural pigments article, seems to be a research paper by Marion Mecklenburg. In brief, the authors of the Mecklenburg paper describe a testing methodology wherein the scientists applied admixtures of zinc white to polyester films, removed the polyester substrates after twenty-eight years of aging, and then performed various stress/strain tests on the paint films. Now let us stop for a second and compare the Mecklenburg paper's testing methodology to practical, real world, conditions. Do you know any artists who paint on smooth polyester thin-films? Who in the audience has removed an old painting from its structural support (canvas, panel, etc.), and then has attempted to bend the unsupported painting? Anyone? </p> <p> Allow me to present an alternate, idealized testing procedure. </p> <p> <b>Step one:</b> prime several sized canvases with an oil-based ground. </p> <p> <b>Step two:</b> apply, with equal thicknesses, a film of pure zinc white to one of the canvases, lead white to another of the canvases, titanium to another, and then, with the remaining canvasses, admixtures of each of the white paints and with other popular pigments, in controlled proportions. </p> <p> <b>Step three:</b> hang all of the canvases in a climate controlled room. </p> <p> <b>Step four:</b> wait for approximately three hundred years. You should have plenty of time to devise a procedure for analyzing the results. </p> <p> Anything less than the above testing procedure, is merely lazy science driven by expedience. Fortunately, in the meantime, we have museums full of old paintings to consider as evidence. Practically all works of art from the 1800s or earlier, were stored in worse-than-ideal environments for hundreds of years prior to the invention of air conditioning and humidity controls, and may be considered as worst-case examples of how a painting completed in 2020 might age. As far as I can tell, any oil painting executed on stretched canvas or linen, aged over one hundred years, and spent any considerable amount of time outside of a museum, will be riddled with cracks in the paint film. On the other hand, many paintings on copper, certain types of wood, or other rigid supports, do not display observable craquelure, even after hundreds of years of natural aging. </p> <div><u class=load-comments id=10></u><div class=comments></div></div><div class=separator></div> </div> </div> <!-- <script src="js/blogcomment.js"></script> --> </html>
