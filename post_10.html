While a bit intense in oil paint, prussian blue gouache has a softer, grayer tone, and, in my opinion, a special synergy with the colors of the northeast Atlantic coastal region of the United States, where I live. Various sources on the web identify prussian blue as marginally lightfast, in other words; the paint may fade when exposed to harsh light. The paint manufaturer reports the prussian blue pigment as perfectly stable in gouache under normal lighting conditions, so I ultimately placed my trust with Winsor and Newton, ignoring warnings from other artists. Over time, one learns to take the recommendations of artists with a grain of salt; if you ask ten artists for their opinion on something, expect to get twenty different answers. </p> <p> Imagine my surprise when I discovered, after leaving a gouache sketch on my sundrenched dining room table for a week (partially covered by a stack of papers), that the light had completely bleached the blue tones out of the exposed region of the painting. Nevertheless, I remembered reading, years ago, about some conclusions from a scientific paper, where the authors had restored faded prussian blue by keeping the paint in a dark room for an extended time. So I tossed my sketch in a dark closet, and forgot about it. </p> <p> At the end of the summer, I went into my coat closet to get a jacket, collected my forgotten sketch, and found that the paint had recovered all of its lost saturation. Pictures below, before and after leaving the painting in a dark room. </p> <p> Overall, prussian blue permanence seems acceptable, although you would want to keep a painting out of direct sunlight, and give the paint an opportunity to rest in the darkness if damaged by light. </p> <img src=img/blog/pb_sun_bleached.jpg class=post-image-large> <p class=label>Fragment of gouache sketch, sun bleached edge</p> <img src=img/blog/pb_restored.jpg class=post-image-large> <p class=label>Fragment of gouache sketch, color restored after two months of total darkness</p> <div><u class=load-comments id=10></u><div class=comments></div></div><div class=separator></div> </div> </div> <!-- <script src="js/blogcomment.js"></script> --> </html>
