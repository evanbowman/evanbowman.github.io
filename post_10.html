I left a sketch lying on my sundrenched dining room table for a few days, with a stack of papers lying on top of it, only to find that most of the blue had bleached out of the exposed areas. I read once that conservators sometimes successfully restore faded prussian blue in paintings by allowing damaged artwork to rest in a dark room. So I tossed my sketch in a closet and forgot about it. </p> <p> At the end of the summer, I went into my coat closet to get a jacket, collected my forgotten sketch, and found that the paint had recovered all of its lost saturation. Pictures below, before and after leaving the painting in a dark room. </p> <p> [Postscript, 2023]: I went through a phase where I loved prussian blue a few years ago, I use it rarely nowadays. </p> <img src=img/blog/pb_sun_bleached.jpg class=post-image-large> <p class=label>Fragment of gouache sketch, sun bleached edge</p> <img src=img/blog/pb_restored.jpg class=post-image-large> <p class=label>Fragment of gouache sketch, color restored after two months of total darkness</p> <div><u class=load-comments id=10></u><div class=comments></div></div><div class=separator></div> </div> </div> <!-- <script src="js/blogcomment.js"></script> --> </html>
