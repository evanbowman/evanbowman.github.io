I make the distinction of chromatic blue, because in one sense, color is contextual, and if you key a picture orange enough, even faint cool grays will look bluish. But pure, saturated blues rarely show up in old paintings, primarily due to a lack of inexpensive, chemically stable blue pigments. </p> <p> I do not mean to suggest that pre-industrial era painters did not have access to blue paint, much to the contrary; a wide array of blue pigments existed throughout the seventeenth century, and even hundreds of year earlier. Going back all the way to the fourteenth century, painters often used pigments such as Azurite and Smalt, the former of which, features notably in the background tone the exceptionally well preserved portrait, below, by Hans Holbein the Younger: </p> <img src=img/blog/lady_with_a_squirrel.jpg class=post-image-large> <p class=label>Lady with a Squirrel, Hans Holbein, c. 1526-8</p> <p> But, sadly, Azurite tends to turn greenish over time, and, in some cases, will start to blacken. Even the well preserved <i>Lady with a Squirrel</i> would have appeared as much more of a purer blue when freshly painted. And some of the other pigments and dyes available at the time, such as Smalt and Indigo, exhibit far less chemical stability than azurite. Smalt fades to a faintly bluish gray over time, and indigo fades to the point of being undiscernible. </p> <p> Only one acceptably stable blue existed prior to 1704; Ultramarine. A gorgeous pigment, but highly scarce, and therefore, highly expensive. Lack of 16th century equivalents of Consumer Price Indices, as well as spotty data, and no real published exchange rates, render calculation of 1600s era materials in todays dollars difficult. But we can still compare the cost of ultramarine to other paints at the time: in early fifteenth century Italy, earth pigments sold for 0.3 baiocchi per ounce, lead white sold for 0.75-0.8 baiocchi per ounce, and Ultramarine for 800 baiocchi per ounce (Hall-Aquitania 2018). Due to issues of cost and availability, well-funded artists tended to use Ultramarine primarily for religious paintings, although Johannes Vermeer, notably, seemed to use the pigment quite friviously, at least compared to his contemporaries. </p> <img src=img/blog/milkmaid-closeup.jpg class=post-image-large> <p class=label>Ultramarine in a closeup of <i>The Milkmaid</i>, Jan Vermeer, c. 1660</p> <p> Everything changed in the year 1704, when a chemist known as Diesbach discoverred a vivid, chemically stable blue paint, completely by accident. In fact, so irregular was the chemical makeup of Diesbach's new blue, that even Diesbach himself, had very little understanding of the chemical structure of the pigment. </p> <p> Diesbach never published any scientific papers recounting the story of how he discoverred what would later become known as Prussian blue, preferring to keep methods for producing the profitable new pigment a closely-guarded secret. The earliest description of Diesbach's serendipitous discovery, appears in a book by German chemist Georg Ernst Van Stahl, twenty five years later. According to Stahl, Diesbach shared lab space with an alchemist by the name Dippel, where Dippel was preparing a distillation of animal blood, which he then mixed with potash. Diesbach, a colorist engaged in the production of a red pigment called Florentine lake, also needed potash for his own experiments, but had run out. He borrowed some of Dippel's, which happened to be contaminated with hexacyanoferrate, and produced a vivid blue precipitate when added to his own dye, rather than the expected red lake (Kraft 2008). </p> <p> While Diesbach had intended to keep the preparation of Prussian blue secret, four years later, in 1708, another chemist in Berlin, Johann Frisch, claimed in a letter that he had reproduced the color better than its inventor, and made the production process more efficient. Frisch seemed to have worked out an arrangement with Diesbach, though, where Diesbach would manufacture the pigment, and Frisch would take responsibility for selling the new color to artists. As the first synthetic pigment, and as the first cheap permanent blue, the paint spread like wildfire; the French painter Watteau adopted the new blue as early as 1710. Some historical evidence suggests that, unable to keep up with demand, German chemists began passing off indigo as Prussian blue (Kraft 2008). By the 1720s, chemists across Europe were producing prussian blue, which became the dominant blue paint for at least one hundred years. Everyone, from American artist Winslow Homer, to Japanese printmakers, to Vincent Van Gogh, now used Prussian blue as their primary source of blue pigment. </p> <img src=img/blog/summer_squall.jpg class=post-image-large> <p class=label>Summer Squall, Winslow Homer, c. 1904</p> <p> Today, Pthalocyanine Blue and synthetic ultramarine seem to have almost completely displaced Prussian blue, except in some special cases, such as printmaking ink. Regretable, as I find Prussian blue to be a beautiful color, with a more noticeable personality than some of the modern synthetic pigments. Once a staple of realist painters, prussian blue seems more at-home today in contemporary abstract artwork, as those who call themselves realists seem to have largely abandoned quiet naturalistic tonality in favor of juiced up high key paintings. </p> <br> <p> <b>References:</b> <br> (1) ON THE DISCOVERY AND HISTORY OF PRUSSIAN BLUE, Alexander Kraft, Gesimat GmbH, Berlin.
