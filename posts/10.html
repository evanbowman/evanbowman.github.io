TITLE,Zinc White Paranoia,DATE,April 7 2020

<p class="paragraph-1">
  As of today, if you navigate to www.google.com, and perform a simple web
  search for the term "Zinc White," you will find a number videos, blogposts, et
  cetera, warning of the dangers of paints made with Zinc(II)-oxide. An
  undiscerning reader, presented with those search results, could be forgiven
  for concluding that zinc white is actually harmful to the integrity of oil
  paint films. But when one actually considers the testing methods in each of
  those articles, and compares said methods to the environmental effects and
  mechanical forces <i>that are actually likely to be experienced by an oil
  painting</i>, one is left wondering whether these articles offer any relevant
  and useful information whatsoever.
</p>

<p>
  Furthermore, a number of sources critical of Zinc white, including Natural
  Pigments and Golden Artist Colors, are actively engaged in marketing and
  selling flake white, a lead-based paint, and the only other popular white
  paint, besides zinc, that mixes clean tints with opaque colors. I, on the
  other hand, have no possible financial motive of any kind for recommending one
  paint over another, and would like to offer another perspective to this whole
  debate.
</p>

<p>
  Let us start by considering the article, "Zinc White: Problems in Oil Paint,"
  on the Natural Pigments website. The whole basis of the natural pigments
  article, seems to be a research paper by Marion Mecklenburg. In brief, the
  authors of the Mecklenburg paper describe a testing methodology wherein the
  scientists applied admixtures of zinc white to polyester films, removed the
  polyester substrates after twenty-eight years of aging, and then performed
  various stress/strain tests on the paint films. Now let us stop for a second
  and compare the Mecklenburg paper's testing methodology to practical, real
  world, conditions. Do you know any artists who paint on smooth polyester
  thin-films?  Who in the audience has removed an old painting from its
  structural support (canvas, panel, etc.), and then has attempted to bend the
  unsupported painting? Anyone?
</p>

<p>
  Allow me to present an alternate, idealized testing procedure.
</p>

<p>
  <b>Step one:</b> prime several sized canvases with an oil-based ground.
</p>

<p>
  <b>Step two:</b> apply, with equal thicknesses, a film of pure zinc white to one of
  the canvases, lead white to another of the canvases, titanium to another, and
  then, with the remaining canvasses, admixtures of each of the white paints and
  with other popular pigments, in controlled proportions.
</p>

<p>
  <b>Step three:</b> hang all of the canvases in a climate controlled room.
</p>

<p>
  <b>Step four:</b> wait for approximately three hundred years. You should have plenty
  of time to devise a procedure for analyzing the results.
</p>

<p>
  Anything less than the above testing procedure, is merely lazy science driven
  by expedience. Fortunately, in the meantime, we have museums full of old
  paintings to consider as evidence. Practically all works of art from the 1800s
  or earlier, were stored in worse-than-ideal environments for hundreds of years
  prior to the invention of air conditioning and humidity controls, and may be
  considered as worst-case examples of how a painting completed in 2020 might
  age. As far as I can tell, any oil painting executed on stretched canvas or
  linen, aged over one hundred years, and spent any considerable amount of time
  outside of a museum, will be riddled with cracks in the paint film. On the
  other hand, many paintings on copper, certain types of wood, or other rigid
  supports, do not display observable craquelure, even after hundreds of years
  of natural aging.
</p>

<p>
  But, sadly, advocates of lead-based oil paints don't seem nearly as concerned
  about the longevity issues inherent in stretched canvas.
