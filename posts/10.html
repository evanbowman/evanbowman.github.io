TITLE,Prussian blue: dark room recovery,DATE,November 19 2021
<p class="paragraph-1">
  Prussian blue, a classical era pigment used by a wide range of visual artists,
  notably Winslow Homer (in practically all of his paintings), Vincent Van Gogh
  (Starry Night), and Hokusai (Great wave), seems to exhibit bizarre
  characteristics when exposed to sunlight for long periods of time. I began
  using Prussian blue gouache within the last few years, mostly for practical
  reasons; prussian blue dries quite dark for a gouache paint, but also for
  subjective reasons; I like the gloomy character and personality of the paint,
  as well as the naturalistic greens mixed from prussian blue and yellow ocher.

<p>
  I knew, years before I started using Prussian blue, about the paint's rumored
  marginal lightfastness, but I never knew how dramatically the paint changes
  when exposed to direct sunlight. This summer, I accidentally left a small
  sketch on my sun-drenched dining room table for a week, with most of the
  painting covered by a stack of papers, only to find that the blue in the
  exposed area of the painting had almost entirely bleached out after a single
  week of exposure.
</p>
<p>
  I had remembered reading an article in a scientific journal, where the authors
  had noted that much of the intensity of sun-bleached prussian blue could be
  restored by leaving a painting in a dark room for a while, so I threw the
  sketch in a closet and forgot about it for a couple of months.
</p>
<p>
  At the end of the summer, I opened my coat closet, collected my forgotten
  sketch, and was surprised to find all of the color restored.
</p>
<p>
  Ultimately, I plan to keep using Prussian blue, despite lightfastness
  concerns, as even severe light damage from direct sunlight seems to be
  reversible.

  Inevitably, as I took the above photos months apart, you'll notice different
  ambient lighting/saturation in the two pictures. But, importantly, you can
  clearly see the restored color in the exposed area. While Prussian blue
  restoration in dark rooms may be common knowledge among art conservators, I
  wanted to share this info, as I happened upon a particulary extreme example of
  sun bleaching followed by nearly total color recovery, and people may not know
  that severe cases of what may at first appear to be UV damage are in fact
  mostly reversible.
