TITLE,Prussian blue: dark room recovery,DATE,November 19 2021
<p class="paragraph-1">
  Prussian blue has such a nice moody character, it's a shame the paint isn't
  more permanent. I left a sketch lying on my sundrenched dining room table for
  a few days, with a stack of papers lying on top of it, only to find that most
  of the blue had bleached out of the exposed areas. I read once that
  conservators sometimes successfully restore faded prussian blue in paintings
  by allowing damaged artwork to rest in a dark room. So I tossed my sketch in a
  closet and forgot about it.

  At the end of the summer, I went into my coat closet to get a jacket,
  collected my forgotten sketch, and found that the paint had recovered all of
  its lost saturation. Pictures below, before and after leaving the painting in
  a dark room.

  [Postscript, 2023]: I went through a phase where I loved prussian blue a few
  years ago, I use it rarely nowadays.
