TITLE,Prussian blue: dark room recovery,DATE,November 19 2021
<p class="paragraph-1">
  Over the past few years, I've begun using a paint called Prussian blue for my
  gouache sketches and prints. While a bit intense in oil paint, prussian blue
  gouache has a softer, grayer tone, and, in my opinion, a special synergy with
  the colors of the northeast Atlantic coastal region of the United States,
  where I live. Various sources on the web identify prussian blue as marginally
  lightfast, in other words; the paint may fade when exposed to harsh light. The
  paint manufaturer reports the prussian blue pigment as perfectly stable in
  gouache under normal lighting conditions, so I ultimately placed my trust with
  Winsor and Newton, ignoring warnings from other artists. Over time, one learns
  to take the recommendations of artists with a grain of salt; if you ask ten
  artists for their opinion on something, expect to get twenty different
  answers.

  Imagine my surprise when I discovered, after leaving a gouache sketch on my
  sundrenched dining room table for a week (partially covered by a stack of
  papers), that the light had completely bleached the blue tones out of the
  exposed region of the painting. Nevertheless, I remembered reading, years ago,
  about some conclusions from a scientific paper, where the authors had restored
  faded prussian blue by keeping the paint in a dark room for an extended
  time. So I tossed my sketch in a dark closet, and forgot about it.

  At the end of the summer, I went into my coat closet to get a jacket,
  collected my forgotten sketch, and found that the paint had recovered all of
  its lost saturation. Pictures below, before and after leaving the painting in
  a dark room.

  Overall, prussian blue permanence seems acceptable, although you would want to
  keep a painting out of direct sunlight, and give the paint an opportunity to
  rest in the darkness if damaged by light.
