  I saw Freud's palette on display at the MFA Boston, included in an exhibition
  of fourty of the artist's self portraits. Freud's colors appear to consist
  mostly of earth tones, as one would expect. The top left of the palette holds
  a large mound of black paint, surrounded by what appear to be an earth red and
  some umbers. The bright muted yellow (center) might be naples yellow. The
  green (top/middle) looks very much like viridian.

<p>
  The only initially surprising element, would be the inclusion of the bright
  chromatic yellow, but when looking at "And the Bridegroom," Freud apparantly
  needed the yellow paint to represent a bright yellow wallpaper in the
  background of the double portrait (Although, from what I have read of Freud,
  e.g. in <i>The Man with the Blue Scarf</i>, the artist did not distinguish
  between the foreground and background, referring to everything as
  simply <i>the ground</i>).

  I took one more photo of Freud's palette from an oblique angle, because I
  wanted to make note of the thickness of the paint in the mixing area of the
  palette&#8212;about a third of an inch thick!
