TITLE,Considering Motion in Portraiture,DATE,August 11 2019
<p>
  On a frigid day last winter, in a warmly-lit studio, I was attending
  my very first figure drawing session. After the first half hour, we
  took a five minute break, and, upon resuming, one of the other
  artists complained that the model had "changed the angle of her
  head." I looked down at my sketch, a study in gouache, and confirmed
  that, yes, she had raised her chin a few degrees. But I've been
  turning this exchange over in my head for a few months, and now, I
  think that small movements in the model are probably essential.

  When one takes issue with subtle movement in a live subject, it begs
  the following question: are you painting a portrait, or a still life
  of a person?

  Of course, the sitter for a portrait should make an effort to assume
  a roughly constant pose throughout. But, at the same time, a
  subject's movements and conversation can give the artist information
  necessary to capture the essential character of the
  subject. Allowing the sitter to move a bit and talk, aside from
  being a less contrived way to produce a painting, can result in a
  more animated, or at least more interesting, portrait. Many
  prominent figures in the history of portrait painting, from John
  Sargent to Lucian Freud, were known to chat with the subjects of
  their paintings during the process.

  Artists like Diego Velazquez paid careful attention to minute
  changes in his subjects, and some of his paintings are so lifelike
  that they almost seem to breathe. As an aside, I've always wanted to
  paint a copy of Juan de Pareja, but I'm not skilled enough yet, and
  I doubt that I could do the painting justice.

  I'm going to close with a painting by Anne Gale, whose very slow
  painting process captures changes changes in her subjects over many
  months. Embracing the transient nature of live subjects produces a
  better result, I think, than treating a painted portrait as a
  recording of an instantaneous moment in time.
