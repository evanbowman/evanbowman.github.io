TITLE,Recommended Reading for Learning to Paint,DATE,Monday July 8
<p>
  Having not had much opportunity to study visual art formally, I
  learn most of what I know from art history books. I've provided a
  curated list of below, of some of the books that have taught me the
  most about painting. While the painters covered in my book
  recommendations were highly virtuosic, whether they are all great
  Artists is subject to ongoing debate. But even in the case of John
  Sargent's more frivolous work, one can still learn a lot of about
  color and composition.

  I should briefly comment on the content in each book. <i>Treavor Chamberlain,
  a personal view</i> offers a collection of watercolors by the artist Treavor
  Chamberlain, who has not only an uncanny gift for painting with an abbreviated
  yet realistic style, but who works with an admirably muted color palette.
</p>

<p>
  <i>John Singer Sargent, Figures and Landscapes</i>. Covers John Sargent's work
  during a five year period, after he had given up formal portraiture. When I
  first saw Sargent's full-length portraits, I was blown away by how skillfull
  they were. Overtime the luster has worn off for me, and my favorite of
  Sargent's work are his non-commissioned work, when he was painting his favorite
  places and people.
</p>

<p>
  <i>Rembrandt, the Late Works</i>. Rembrandt, during his late period, when his
  paintings were the thickest and most textural. Includes <i>Self Portrait with
  two Circles</i>, <i>The Jewish Bride</i> etc. Some of these paintings are so
  perfect I wonder if I'm wasting my time with painting, Rembrandt set the bar
  really high.
</p>

<p>
  <i>Velazquez. The Complete Works</i>. Every painting by Spanish golden-age
  painter Diego Velazquez. This large-format book probably weighs twenty pounds.
</p>

<p>
  <i>Beauty In the City, The Ashcan School</i> focuses on New York City painters
  from the early 1900s, such as George Bellows, Robert Henri, and John Sloan. Of
  all the books in this list, <i>Beauty In the City</i> is nearest to an Art
  History book and furthest from a picture book.
</p>

<p>
  <i>Franz Kline</i>. Kline has always been my favorite abstract expressionist.
