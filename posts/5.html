TITLE,I Miss the Winter Light,DATE,Friday August 2
<p>
  Lately I've been grappling with an unexpected paradox when painting pictures
  outdoors. The winters can get uncomfortably cold here in Boston, while at the
  same time, I prefer to work in the winter light. I have never spoken with any
  professional artists, but I expect that many of them would agree&#8212;some of
  the most exciting light effects happen when the sun reaches a low angle in the
  sky.

  In the summer, where I live, the sunlight is harsh and colorless between
  9:30AM and 2:30PM, to the extent that I have practically no interest in
  painting outdoor subjects during the middle of the day. In mid winter, on the
  other hand, the angle of the sun never trends too high, so all the light is
  good for painting, and is not so bright as to hurt one's eyes. I'm looking
  forward to the fall months when the light starts to get interesting again.
