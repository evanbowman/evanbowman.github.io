TITLE,Yellows in Oil Painting,DATE,August 11 2019

  I find yellows to be the most challenging range of colors to use
  correctly, and I'd like to share some suggestions for color mixing
  with yellows, in case the information might be useful to someone
  else. Of course, what works for one person often doesn't work for
  another, so if you have a different method that works for you, then
  that's great too.

  I prefer to use transparent pigments throughout the majority of my
  paintings. The natural world is full of grays, and transparent
  paints excel at producing clean gray tints. I like to have both a
  stronger and a weaker transparent yellow on hand, for example;
  Nickel Azo Yellow paired with Raw Sienna. In the color chart below, I've
  included my favorite three weak yellows on the left, and my favorite
  three strong yellows on the right.

  I've avoided opaque yellows in the past, because when used
  excessively, I think that bright opaque yellows can make a painting
  look immature. But I admit, sometimes you still need an opaque
  yellow. Yellow Ocher Pale (PY42, sometimes also called Mars Yellow)
  works well, and you can get some stronger semi-opaque yellows by
  mixing a little Indian Yellow or Green Gold into the pale
  ocher. Recently, I also started using Nickel Titanate Yellow, a nice
  bright lemon yellow, sort of similar to Lead Tin Lemon Yellow used
  by the old masters.
