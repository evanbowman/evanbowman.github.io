TITLE,Pyrrole Red,DATE,Monday July 15
<p>
  A few weeks ago I started using Winsor and Newton's Bright Red
  (PR254), and based on my experience so far, I do not think that I
  will Cadmium paints much in the future, except in cases where I
  absolutely need opacity. A lot of painters are moving away from
  Cadmium-based pigments due to concerns over toxicity&#8212;concerns
  that seem a little overblown to me. My own reluctance toward cadmium
  paints stems from other properties of the pigments; my impression is
  that cadmiums are just difficult to mix with. I dropped the yellow
  cadmiums from my palette shortly after I started painting, because I
  feel that bright yellows impart an immature and superficial quality
  on artwork. I also tended to avoid bright reds for the same reason,
  but still kept Cadmium-Red around for occasional use&#8212;the
  medium variant is quite nice.

  Pyrrole reds are just as saturated, in the masstone, as cadmiums,
  but lean more toward pure primary red. And Pyrrole's
  <a href="post_2.html">transparency</a> lends itself better to
  producing clean grays. I find myself using Pyrrole sometimes for
  bright accents in still-life, and more frequently for figure
  painting. I sketched a few copies of Velazquez portraits last month,
  and enjoyed using a palette containing Pyrrole, Viridian, Cobalt,
  and some earth tones.
