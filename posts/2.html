<h3>Thoughts on Color Mixing and Transparency</h3>
<p>
  Over the past few years, I have spent a lot of time looking at
  art, and I have begun to notice a common technical error in
  the work of both newer and experienced painters alike&#8212;a
  lack of understanding of opacity when it comes to color
  mixing. My own work, in fact, suffered from the same types of
  errors, until I spent some time experimenting with watercolor,
  and I developed a new appreciation for the importance of
  transparency in the cleanliness of color mixtures.
<p>

<p>
  A common refrain, from art books and artists' blogs, is that
  if a painter is interested in keeping color mixtures clean,
  one should avoid mixing more than two colors together. I can
  think of plenty of instances, though, where even two colors
  mixed together would produce an unpleasent result&#8212;take,
  for example, the chalky tint made from titanium white and
  cadmium red. So I would like to make an amendment of my own: a
  paint mixture should include no more than one opaque color. In
  my experience, any number of transparent colors can be mixed
  together without yielding a dirty color mixture, but even two
  opaque colors mixed starts to go downhill fast.
</p>

<p>
  While a palette consisting of only transparent paints may not
  be suitable for painting sunny landscapes, one can use an
  almost fully transparent palette of colors indoors with great
  success. For anyone who has not explored direct-painting in
  oils with a glazing palette, I warmly recommend that you try.
</p>

<p>
  My standard palette for still life painting, portraits, and
  master copies, consists of the following pigments. I get my
  colors mostly from Winsor & Newton and M. Graham, but I've
  included the pigment codes in case anyone uses other brands.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Flake White Hue* <sub>(PW4+PW6)</sub></li>
  <!-- <li>Yellow Ocher <sub>(PY42)</li> -->
  <li>Nickel Azo Yellow <sub>(PY150)</sub></li>
  <li>Raw Sienna <sub>(PY42+PY43)</sub></li>
  <li>Burnt Sienna <sub>(PR101)</sub></li>
  <li>Permanent Alizarin Crimson <sub>(PR206)</sub></li>
  <li>Ivory Black* <sub>(PBK7)</sub></li>
  <li>French Ultramarine <sub>(PB29)</sub></li>
  <li>Viridian <sub>(PG18)</sub></li>
</ul>

<p>
  * Zinc white and Ivory Black have some known cracking issues
  when painted on flexible supports. I paint of rigid panels,
  with an oil-based ground, and I recommend that you do the
  same.
</p>

<p>
  Sometimes I also use brighter colors, like Cerulean, Yellow
  Ocher, and Pyrrole Red, but I don't pull them out until the
  end of a painting, where I might need a strong accent.
