A lot of painters are moving away from Cadmium-based pigments due to concerns over toxicity--concerns that seem a little overblown to me. My own disinclination toward cadmium paints stems from other properties of the pigments; my impression is that cadmiums are just difficult to mix with. I dropped the yellow cadmiums from my palette shortly after I started painting, because I feel that bright yellows impart an immature and superficial quality on artwork. I also tended to avoid bright reds for the same reason, but still kept Cadmium-Red around for occasional use--the medium variant is quite nice. </p> <p> Pyrrole reds are just as saturated, in the masstone, as cadmiums, but lean more toward pure primary red. And Pyrrole's <a href=post_2.html>transparency</a> lends itself better to producing clean grays. I find myself using Pyrrole sometimes for bright accents in still-life, and more frequently for figure painting. I sketched a few copies of Velazquez portraits last month, and enjoyed using a palette containing Pyrrole (PR254): </p> <ul> <li>Flake White Hue <sub>(PW4+PW6)</sub></li> <li>Yellow Ocher <sub>(PY42)</li> <li>Transparent Gold Ocher <sub>(PY42+PY43)</sub></li> <li>Burnt Umber <sub>(PBr7)</sub></li> <li>Burnt Sienna <sub>(PBr7)</sub></li> <li>Bright Red <sub>(PR254)</sub></li> <li>Viridian <sub>(PG18)</sub></li> <li>Ivory Black <sub>(PBK7)</sub></li> </ul> <div><u class=load-comments id=4></u><div class=comments></div></div><div class=separator></div><span class=date>Monday July 8 </span><h3><a class=title-link href=post_3.html>Recommended Reading for Learning to Paint</a></h3><p> Having not had much opportunity to study visual art formally, I learn most of what I know from art history books. I've provided a curated list of below, of some of the books that have taught me the most about painting. While the painters covered in my book recommendations were highly virtuosic, whether they are all great Artists is subject to ongoing debate. But even in the case of John Sargent's more frivolous work, one can still learn a lot of about color and composition. </p> <div class=trifold> <img class=trifold-content src=img/blog/tc_watercolor_book.png> <img class=trifold-content src=img/blog/jss_1908-1913.png> <img class=trifold-content src=img/blog/rembrandt_late_works.png> <img class=trifold-content src=img/blog/velazquez_complete_works.png> <img class=trifold-content src=img/blog/beauty_in_the_city.png> <img class=trifold-content src=img/blog/franz_kline.png> </div> <p> Images, left to right, top to bottom: <b>1)</b> <i>Treavor Chamberlain, a personal view</i>, ISBN: 0-7153-0845-9, <b>2)</b> <i>John Singer Sargent, Figures and Landscapes</i>, 1908-1913.

Covers John Sargent's work during a five year period, after he had given up formal portraiture. When I first saw Sargent's full-length portraits, I was blown away by how skillfull they were. Overtime the luster has worn off for me, and my favorite of Sargent's work are his non-commissioned work, when he was painting his favorite places and people. </p> <p> <i>Rembrandt, the Late Works</i>. Rembrandt, during his late period, when his paintings were the thickest and most textural. Includes <i>Self Portrait with two Circles</i>, <i>The Jewish Bride</i> etc. Some of these paintings are so perfect I wonder if I'm wasting my time with painting, Rembrandt set the bar really high. </p> <p> <i>Velazquez. The Complete Works</i>. Every painting by Spanish golden-age painter Diego Velazquez. This large-format book probably weighs twenty pounds. </p> <p> <i>Beauty In the City, The Ashcan School</i> focuses on New York City painters from the early 1900s, such as George Bellows, Robert Henri, and John Sloan. Of all the books in this list, <i>Beauty In the City</i> is nearest to an Art History book and furthest from a picture book. </p> <p> <i>Franz Kline</i>. Kline has always been my favorite abstract expressionist. </p> <div><u class=load-comments id=3></u><div class=comments></div></div><div class=separator></div><span class=date>Friday June 28 </span><h3><a class=title-link href=post_2.html>Thoughts on Color Mixing and Transparency</a></h3><p> Over the past few years, I have spent a lot of time looking at art, and I have begun to notice a common technical error in the work of both newer and experienced painters alike&#8212;a lack of understanding of opacity when it comes to color mixing. My own work, in fact, suffered from the same types of errors, until I spent some time experimenting with watercolor, and I developed a new appreciation for the importance of transparency in the cleanliness of color mixtures. <p> <p> A common refrain, from art books and artists' blogs, is that if a painter is interested in keeping color mixtures clean, one should avoid mixing more than two colors together. I can think of plenty of instances, though, where even two colors mixed together would produce an unpleasent result&#8212;take, for example, the chalky tint made from titanium white and cadmium red. So I would like to make an amendment of my own: a paint mixture should include no more than one opaque color. In my experience, any number of transparent colors can be mixed together without yielding a dirty color mixture, but even two opaque colors mixed starts to go downhill fast. </p> <p> While a palette consisting of only transparent paints may not be suitable for painting sunny landscapes, one can use an almost fully transparent palette of colors indoors with great success. For anyone who has not explored direct-painting in oils with a glazing palette, I warmly recommend that you try. </p> <p> My standard palette for still life painting, portraits, and master copies, consists of the following pigments. I get my colors mostly from Winsor & Newton and M. Graham, but I've included the pigment codes in case anyone uses other brands. </p> <ul> <li>Flake White Hue* <sub>(PW4+PW6)</sub></li> <!-- <li>Yellow Ocher <sub>(PY42)</li> --> <li>Nickel Azo Yellow <sub>(PY150)</sub></li> <li>Raw Sienna <sub>(PY42+PY43)</sub></li> <li>Burnt Sienna <sub>(PR101)</sub></li> <li>Permanent Alizarin Crimson <sub>(PR206)</sub></li> <li>Ivory Black* <sub>(PBK7)</sub></li> <li>French Ultramarine <sub>(PB29)</sub></li> <li>Viridian <sub>(PG18)</sub></li> </ul> <p> * Zinc white and Ivory Black have some known cracking issues when painted on flexible supports. I paint of rigid panels, with an oil-based ground, and I recommend that you do the same. </p> <p> Sometimes I also use brighter colors, like Cerulean, Yellow Ocher, and Pyrrole Red, but I don't pull them out until the end of a painting, where I might need a strong accent. </p> <img src=img/blog/palette.png class=post-image-large> <div><u class=load-comments id=2></u><div class=comments></div></div><div class=separator></div><span class=date>Friday June 28 </span><h3><a class=title-link href=post_1.html>I Launched a Website</a></h3><p> I set up a website for sharing my paintings and programming projects, and for posting technical information about visual art and art history. </p> <div><u class=load-comments id=1></u><div class=comments></div></div><div class=separator></div> </div> </div> <script src=js/blogcomment.js></script> </html>
