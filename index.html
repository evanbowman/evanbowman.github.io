      <p>
        Born in Fairfax Virginia, United States, 1995.

      <p>
        My Mother, a graphic designer and painter, gave me my introduction to
        visual art, during my early years growing up. When I first expressed
        interest in learning painting more seriously, Mom bought me a set of
        gouache paints, and, to this day, gouache feels the most comfortable
        medium in my hands.
      </p>

      <p>
        I continued my art education in high school, where my drawing teacher
        encouraged me to pursue a career in illustration, believing that I had
        the necessary level of dedication and creativity. I decided to study
        biomedical engineering instead, thus ending my formal art education. I
        went on to collaborate on some biotech research, was eventually
        published as a coauthor in a scientific journal, but would later
        change directions to study computer programming. With little work
        experience thus far, I spent my first summer and winter vacations
        during college working in a factory, folding and packing and stacking
        boxes. The work was often physically exhausting, but looking back, it
        was an important formative experience for me.
      </p>

      <p>
        While in college, I slowly started to get back in to visual art,
        making pixel-art animations for some computer games I was
        developing. I graduated with a bachelors of science in computer
        engineering from Boston University, and started a career with a
        brokerage writing low latency software for high frequency trading
        applications. Spending so much time dealing with computers at my job,
        I redeveloped an interest in traditional painting outside of work. I
        enjoy the feel of the physical materials, the textural properties of
        the various pigments and mediums.
      </p>

      <p>
        I am still finding my way as an artist, trying to communicate
        something about my own life and experience by recording my response in
        paint to the subjects that catch my interest. My style and interests
        have changed since I started painting, and I expect that they will
        continue to change. I created this website in hopes that I can share
        my work, and what I have learned, with all of you.
