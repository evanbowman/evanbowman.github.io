Of course, what works for one person often doesn't work for another, so if you have a different method that works for you, then that's great too. </p> <p> I prefer to use transparent pigments throughout the majority of my paintings. The natural world is full of grays, and transparent paints excel at producing clean gray tints. I like to have both a stronger and a weaker transparent yellow on hand, for example; Nickel Azo Yellow paired with Raw Sienna. In the color chart below, I've included my favorite three weak yellows on the left, and my favorite three strong yellows on the right. </p> <p> I've avoided opaque yellows in the past, because when used excessively, I think that bright opaque yellows can make a painting look immature. Someone told me once (years ago), upon looking at a painting that I'd just done, that if I made more paintings in a similar colorful style, that I could sell them at a craft fair. Right then I stopped using Cadmium Yellow, and started painting subjects under cooler light sources. But I admit, sometimes you still need an opaque yellow. Yellow Ocher Pale (PY42, sometimes also called Mars Yellow) works well, and you can get some stronger semi-opaque yellows by mixing a little Indian Yellow or Green Gold into the pale ocher. Recently, I also started using Nickel Titanate Yellow, a nice bright lemon yellow, sort of similar to Lead Tin Lemon Yellow used by the old masters. </p> <p> </p> <img src=img/blog/transparent_yellows.png class=post-image-large> <p> Pictured above, from left to right: </p> <li>Michael Harding French Yellow Ocher</li> <li>Winsor Newton (W & N) Raw Sienna</li> <li>W & N Tranparent Gold Ocher</li> <li>W & N Indian Yellow</li> <li>W & N Indian Yellow Deep</li> <li>W & N Green Gold.</li> <div><u class=load-comments id=7></u><div class=comments></div></div><div class=separator></div><span class=date>August 11 2019 </span><h3><a class=title-link href=post_6.html>Considering Motion in Portraiture</a></h3><p> On a frigid day last winter, in a warmly-lit studio, I was attending my very first figure drawing session. After the first half hour, we took a five minute break, and, upon resuming, one of the other artists complained that the model had assumed a slightly different position. I looked down at my sketch, a study in gouache, and confirmed that, yes, she had raised her chin a few degrees. But I've been turning this exchange over in my head for a few months, and now, I think that small movements in the model are probably essential. </p> <p> When one takes issue with subtle movement in a live subject, it begs the following question: are you painting a portrait, or a still life of a person? </p> <p> Of course, the sitter for a portrait should make an effort to assume a roughly constant pose throughout. But, at the same time, a subject's movements and conversation can give the artist information necessary to capture the essential character of the subject. Allowing the sitter to move a bit and talk, aside from being a less contrived way to produce a painting, can result in a more animated, or at least more interesting, portrait. Many prominent figures in the history of portrait painting, from John Sargent to Lucian Freud, were known to chat with the subjects of their paintings during the process. </p> <p> Artists like Diego Velazquez paid careful attention to minute changes in his subjects, and some of his paintings are so lifelike that they almost seem to breathe. As an aside, I've always wanted to paint a copy of Juan de Pareja, but I'm not skilled enough yet, and I doubt that I could do the painting justice. </p> <img src=img/blog/juan_de_pareja.jpg class=post-image-large> <p class=label>Diego Velazquez, Juan De Pareja, 1650</p> <p> I'm going to close with a painting by Anne Gale, whose very slow painting process captures changes changes in her subjects over many months. Embracing the transient nature of live subjects produces a better result, I think, than treating a painted portrait as a recording of an instantaneous moment in time. </p> <img src=img/blog/ann_gale_rachelwblue.jpg class=post-image-large> <p class=label>Anne Gale, Rachel With Blue, 2012</p> <div><u class=load-comments id=6></u><div class=comments></div></div><div class=separator></div><span class=date>August 2 2019 </span><h3><a class=title-link href=post_5.html>I Miss the Winter Light</a></h3><p> Lately I've been grappling with an unexpected paradox when painting pictures outdoors. The winters can get uncomfortably cold here in Boston, while at the same time, I prefer to work in the winter light. I have never spoken with any professional artists, but I expect that many of them would agree&#8212;some of the most exciting light effects happen when the sun reaches a low angle in the sky. </p> <p> In the summer, where I live, the sunlight is harsh and colorless between 9:30AM and 2:30PM, to the extent that I have practically no interest in painting outdoor subjects during the middle of the day. In mid winter, on the other hand, the angle of the sun never trends too high, so all the light is good for painting, and is not so bright as to hurt one's eyes. I'm looking forward to the fall months when the light starts to get interesting again. </p> <img src=img/blog/solar_altitude.svg class=post-image-large> <div><u class=load-comments id=5></u><div class=comments></div></div><div class=separator></div><span class=date>July 8 2019 </span><h3><a class=title-link href=post_3.html>Recommended Reading for Learning to Paint</a></h3><p> Having not had much opportunity to study visual art formally, I learn most of what I know from art history books. I've provided a curated list of below, of some of the books that have taught me the most about painting. While the painters covered in my book recommendations were highly virtuosic, whether they are all great Artists is subject to ongoing debate. But even in the case of John Sargent's more frivolous work, one can still learn a lot of about color and composition. </p> <div class=trifold> <img class=trifold-content src=img/blog/tc_watercolor_book.png> <img class=trifold-content src=img/blog/jss_1908-1913.png> <img class=trifold-content src=img/blog/rembrandt_late_works.png> <img class=trifold-content src=img/blog/velazquez_complete_works.png> <img class=trifold-content src=img/blog/beauty_in_the_city.png> <img class=trifold-content src=img/blog/franz_kline.png> </div> <p> Images, left to right, top to bottom: <b>1)</b> <i>Treavor Chamberlain, a personal view</i>, ISBN: 0-7153-0845-9, <b>2)</b> <i>John Singer Sargent, Figures and Landscapes</i>, 1908-1913.

Covers John Sargent's work during a five year period, after he had given up formal portraiture. When I first saw Sargent's full-length portraits, I was blown away by how skillfull they were. Overtime the luster has worn off for me, and my favorite of Sargent's work are his non-commissioned work, when he was painting his favorite places and people. </p> <p> <i>Rembrandt, the Late Works</i>. Rembrandt, during his late period, when his paintings were the thickest and most textural. Includes <i>Self Portrait with two Circles</i>, <i>The Jewish Bride</i> etc. Some of these paintings are so perfect I wonder if I'm wasting my time with painting, Rembrandt set the bar really high. </p> <p> <i>Velazquez. The Complete Works</i>. Every painting by Spanish golden-age painter Diego Velazquez. This large-format book probably weighs twenty pounds. </p> <p> <i>Beauty In the City, The Ashcan School</i> focuses on New York City painters from the early 1900s, such as George Bellows, Robert Henri, and John Sloan. Of all the books in this list, <i>Beauty In the City</i> is nearest to an Art History book and furthest from a picture book. </p> <p> <i>Franz Kline</i>. Kline has always been my favorite abstract expressionist. </p> <div><u class=load-comments id=3></u><div class=comments></div></div><div class=separator></div><span class=date>June 28 2019 </span><h3><a class=title-link href=post_2.html>Thoughts on Color Mixing and Transparency</a></h3><p> Over the past few years, I have spent a lot of time looking at art, and I have begun to notice a common technical error in the work of both newer and experienced painters alike&#8212;a lack of understanding of opacity when it comes to color mixing. My own work, in fact, suffered from the same types of errors, until I spent some time experimenting with watercolor, and I developed a new appreciation for the importance of transparency in the cleanliness of color mixtures. <p> <p> A common refrain, from art books and artists' blogs, is that if a painter is interested in keeping color mixtures clean, one should avoid mixing more than two colors together. I can think of plenty of instances, though, where even two colors mixed together would produce an unpleasent result&#8212;take, for example, the chalky tint made from titanium white and cadmium red. So I would like to make an amendment of my own: a paint mixture should include no more than one opaque color. In my experience, any number of transparent colors can be mixed together without yielding a dirty color mixture, but even two opaque colors mixed starts to go downhill fast. </p> <p> While a palette consisting of only transparent paints may not be suitable for painting sunny landscapes, one can use an almost fully transparent palette of colors indoors with great success. For anyone who has not explored direct-painting in oils with a glazing palette, I warmly recommend that you try. </p> <p> My standard palette for still life painting, portraits, and master copies, consists of the following pigments. I get my colors mostly from Winsor & Newton and M. Graham, but I've included the pigment codes in case anyone uses other brands. </p> <ul> <li>Flake White Hue* <sub>(PW4+PW6)</sub></li> <!-- <li>Yellow Ocher <sub>(PY42)</li> --> <li>Nickel Azo Yellow <sub>(PY150)</sub></li> <li>Raw Sienna <sub>(PY42+PY43)</sub></li> <li>Burnt Sienna <sub>(PR101)</sub></li> <li>Permanent Alizarin Crimson <sub>(PR206)</sub></li> <li>Ivory Black* <sub>(PBK7)</sub></li> <li>French Ultramarine <sub>(PB29)</sub></li> <li>Viridian <sub>(PG18)</sub></li> </ul> <p> * Zinc white and Ivory Black have some known cracking issues when painted on flexible supports. I paint of rigid panels, with an oil-based ground, and I recommend that you do the same. </p> <p> Sometimes I also use brighter colors, like Cerulean, Yellow Ocher, and Pyrrole Red, but I don't pull them out until the end of a painting, where I might need a strong accent. </p> <img src=img/blog/palette.png class=post-image-medium> <p class=label>Evan Bowman, palette, 2019</p> <div><u class=load-comments id=2></u><div class=comments></div></div><div class=separator></div><span class=date>June 28 2019 </span><h3><a class=title-link href=post_1.html>I Launched a Website</a></h3><p> I set up a website for sharing my projects, and sharing information about subjects that I am interested in. </p> <div><u class=load-comments id=1></u><div class=comments></div></div><div class=separator></div> </div> </div> <script src=js/blogcomment.js></script> </html>
