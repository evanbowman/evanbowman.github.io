Freud's materials appear to consist mostly of earth tones, as one would expect. The top left of the palette holds a large mound of black paint, surrounded by what appear to be an earth red and some umbers. The bright muted yellow (center) might be naples yellow. The green (top/middle) looks very much like viridian. </p> <p> The only initially surprising element, would be the inclusion of the bright chromatic yellow, but when looking at "And the Bridegroom," Freud apparantly needed the yellow paint to represent a bright yellow wallpaper in the background of the double portrait (Although, from what I have read of Freud, e.g. in <i>The Man with the Blue Scarf</i>, the artist did not distinguish between the foreground and background, referring to everything as simply <i>the ground</i>). </p> <p> I took one more photo of Freud's palette from an oblique angle, because I wanted to make note of the thickness of the paint in the mixing area of the palette&#8212;about a third of an inch thick! </p> <img src=img/blog/freud_palette_mixing_area.jpg class=post-image-large> <div><u class=load-comments id=9></u><div class=comments></div></div><div class=separator></div><span class=date>November 13 2019 </span><h3><a class=title-link href=post_8.html>Impressions of Turner Watercolor Show at Mystic Seaport Museum</a></h3><img src=img/blog/turner_artist_and_his_admirers.jpg class=post-image-large> <p class=label>The Artist and his Admirers, 1827</p> <p> Last weekend I drove out to Mystic Connecticut to see a collection of JMW Turner's watercolors at the Seaport Museum, on loan from the Tate Britian. Turner, a child prodigy who completed tens of thousands of works on paper over the course of his lifetime, seems remembered mostly for his oil paintings. And I suppose unsurprisingly&#8212;the artist, largely unconcerned with posterity, favored fugitive red and yellow lake pigments, leading conservators to store away his fleeting watercolors in the darker backrooms of museums. The show at the Seaport Museum offers more of Turner's work than I have ever seen in one place. </p> <p> The curators helpfully arranged the collection chronologically, so you can see the progression of the painter's work. Quality varies widely from picture to picture; some of the watercolor sketches are overworked, overly detailed, and washed out. You could argue that, sure, the artist never intended the preparatory works for public consumption, but neither did he intend for the abstract painterly color studies for public display. And the latter are enchanting. </p> <p> While some Turner's more detailed sketches in pure watercolor underwhelm, particularly the ones from early in the artist's career, others stand out as truly exceptional. In <i>San Giorgio - Early Morning</i> (below), Turner perfectly captures the esscence of unbroken water, suffused with light, smooth as glass. </p> <img src=img/blog/san_giorgio_maggiore_early_morning.jpg class=post-image-large> <p class=label>Venice: San Giorgio - Early Morning, 1819</p> <p> Moving into the later work, the painter's watercolors trend further toward absraction, drawn with increasing confidence and fewer details. Without the descriptions, one does not always immediately recognize the subject, as Turner is more interested in recording color, light, and gesture than specific details about the subject. </p> <img src=img/blog/turner_a_shipwreck_at_sea.jpg class=post-image-large> <p class=label>A Shipwreck in a Stormy Sea, c.1823-26</p> <p> The real stars of the show may be a number of tiny gouache and bodycolor works from Turner's sketchbooks, many of which he worked up in translucent to opaque layers on mottled blue paper. The work <i>Dinant, Bouvignes and Cr&#233;vecoeur: Sunset</i> (below) anticipates impressionism in a sense, with warm tones of the rocks in pure vermillion, the warm light on the limestone cliffs pushed towards a spectral yellow-orange, and the shadows cooled down to blue-violet tones. At a distance (or when squinting) the picture resolves into a realistic, albeit colorful, representation of the subject. </p> <img src=img/blog/turner_dinant_bouvignes_and_crevecoeur_sunset.jpg class=post-image-large> <p class=label>Dinant, Bouvignes and Cr&#233;vecoeur: Sunset, c.1839</p> <p> I took notes while walking through the gallery and later, I may publish a list of some of the highlights of the exhibit. For now, the show runs until February, and I would not want to spoil all the surprises, so go see for yourself if you live nearby. </p> <div><u class=load-comments id=8></u><div class=comments></div></div><div class=separator></div><span class=date>August 11 2019 </span><h3><a class=title-link href=post_7.html>Yellows in Oil Painting</a></h3><p> I find yellows to be the most challenging range of colors to use correctly, and I'd like to share some suggestions for color mixing with yellows, in case the information might be useful to someone else. Of course, what works for one person often doesn't work for another, so if you have a different method that works for you, then that's great too. </p> <p> I prefer to use transparent pigments throughout the majority of my paintings. The natural world is full of grays, and transparent paints excel at producing clean gray tints. I like to have both a stronger and a weaker transparent yellow on hand, for example; Indian Yellow paired with Raw Sienna. In the color chart below, I've included my favorite three weak yellows on the left, and my favorite three strong yellows on the right. </p> <p> I've avoided opaque yellows in the past, because when used excessively, I think that bright opaque yellows can make a painting look immature. While I admire loosely painted impressionest works, with their pure passages of chrome yellows, my own style tends toward a tighter, more linear means of expression. I think that use of bright yellows and reds in a hard-edged linear painting makes the result look like a glossy magazine illustration, so I tend to favor earthier pigments. <p> <p> But I admit, sometimes you still need an opaque yellow. Yellow Ocher Pale (PY42, sometimes also called Mars Yellow) works well, and one can achieve some stronger semi-opaque yellows by mixing a little Indian Yellow or Green Gold into the pale ocher. Recently, I also started using Nickel Titanate Yellow, a nice bright desaturated lemon yellow, sort of similar to Lead Tin Lemon Yellow employed by the baroque masters. </p> <p> </p> <img src=img/blog/transparent_yellows.png class=post-image-large> <p> Pictured above, from left to right: </p> <li>Michael Harding French Yellow Ocher</li> <li>Winsor Newton (W & N) Raw Sienna</li> <li>W & N Tranparent Gold Ocher</li> <li>W & N Indian Yellow</li> <li>W & N Indian Yellow Deep</li> <li>W & N Green Gold.</li> <div><u class=load-comments id=7></u><div class=comments></div></div><div class=separator></div><span class=date>June 28 2019 </span><h3><a class=title-link href=post_2.html>Thoughts on Color Mixing and Transparency</a></h3><p> Over the past few years, I have spent a lot of time looking at art, and I have begun to notice a common technical error in the work of both newer and experienced painters alike&#8212;a lack of understanding of opacity when it comes to color mixing. My own work, in fact, suffered from the same types of errors, until I spent some time experimenting with watercolor, and I developed a new appreciation for the importance of transparency in the cleanliness of color mixtures. <p> <p> A common refrain, from art books and artists' blogs, is that if a painter is interested in keeping color mixtures clean, one should avoid mixing more than two colors together. I can think of plenty of instances, though, where even two colors mixed together would produce an unpleasent result&#8212;take, for example, the chalky tint made from titanium white and cadmium red. So I would like to make an amendment of my own: a paint mixture should include no more than one opaque color. In my experience, any number of transparent colors can be mixed together without yielding a dirty color mixture, but even two opaque colors mixed starts to go downhill fast. </p> <p> While a palette consisting of only transparent paints may not be suitable for painting sunny landscapes, one can use an almost fully transparent palette of colors indoors with great success. For anyone who has not explored direct-painting in oils with a glazing palette, I warmly recommend that you try. </p> <p> My standard palette for still life painting, portraits, and master copies, consists of the following pigments. I get my colors mostly from Winsor & Newton and M. Graham, but I've included the pigment codes in case anyone uses other brands. </p> <ul> <li>Flake White Hue* <sub>(PW4+PW6)</sub></li> <!-- <li>Yellow Ocher <sub>(PY42)</li> --> <li>Nickel Azo Yellow <sub>(PY150)</sub></li> <li>Raw Sienna <sub>(PY42+PY43)</sub></li> <li>Burnt Sienna <sub>(PR101)</sub></li> <li>Permanent Alizarin Crimson <sub>(PR206)</sub></li> <li>Ivory Black* <sub>(PBK7)</sub></li> <li>French Ultramarine <sub>(PB29)</sub></li> <li>Viridian <sub>(PG18)</sub></li> </ul> <p> * Zinc white and Ivory Black have some known cracking issues when painted on flexible supports. I paint of rigid panels, with an oil-based ground, and I recommend that you do the same. </p> <p> Sometimes I also use brighter colors, like Cerulean, Yellow Ocher, and Pyrrole Red, but I don't pull them out until the end of a painting, where I might need a strong accent. </p> <img src=img/blog/palette.png class=post-image-medium> <p class=label>Evan Bowman, palette, 2019</p> <div><u class=load-comments id=2></u><div class=comments></div></div><div class=separator></div><span class=date>June 28 2019 </span><h3><a class=title-link href=post_1.html>I Launched a Website</a></h3><p> I set up a website for sharing my projects, and sharing information about subjects that I am interested in. </p> <div><u class=load-comments id=1></u><div class=comments></div></div><div class=separator></div> </div> </div> <!-- <script src="js/blogcomment.js"></script> --> </html>
