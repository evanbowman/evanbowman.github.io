      <h3>Thoughts on Color Mixing and Transparency</h3>
      <p>
        Over the past few years, I have spent a lot of time looking at
        art, and I have begun to notice a common technical error in
        the work of both newer and experienced painters alike&#8212;a
        lack of understanding of opacity when it comes to color
        mixing. My own work, in fact, suffered from the same types of
        errors, until I spent some time experimenting with watercolor,
        and I developed a new appreciation for the importance of
        transparency in the cleanliness of color mixtures.
      <p>

      <p>
        A common refrain, from art books and artists' blogs, is that
        if a painter is interested in keeping color mixtures clean,
        one should avoid mixing more than two colors together. I can
        think of plenty of instances, though, where even two colors
        mixed together would produce an unpleasent result&#8212;take,
        for example, the chalky tint made from titanium white and
        cadmium red. So I would like to make an amendment of my own: a
        paint mixture should include no more than one opaque color. In
        my experience, any number of transparent colors can be mixed
        together without yielding a dirty color mixture, but even two
        opaque colors mixed starts to go downhill fast.
      </p>

      <p>
        While a palette consisting of only transparent paints may not
        be suitable for painting sunny landscapes, one can use an
        almost fully transparent palette of colors indoors with great
        success. For anyone who has not explored direct-painting in
        oils with a glazing palette, I warmly recommend that you try.
      </p>

      <p>
        My standard palette for still life painting, portraits, and
        master copies, consists of the following pigments. I get my
        colors mostly from Winsor & Newton and M. Graham, but I've
        included the pigment codes in case anyone uses other brands.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Flake White Hue* <sub>(PW4+PW6)</sub></li>
        <!-- <li>Yellow Ocher <sub>(PY42)</li> -->
        <li>Nickel Azo Yellow <sub>(PY150)</sub></li>
        <li>Raw Sienna <sub>(PY42+PY43)</sub></li>
        <li>Burnt Sienna <sub>(PR101)</sub></li>
        <li>Permanent Alizarin Crimson <sub>(PR206)</sub></li>
        <li>Ivory Black* <sub>(PBK7)</sub></li>
        <li>French Ultramarine <sub>(PB29)</sub></li>
        <li>Viridian <sub>(PG18)</sub></li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        * Zinc white and Ivory Black have some known cracking issues
        when painted on flexible supports. I paint of rigid panels,
        with an oil-based ground, and I recommend that you do the
        same.
      </p>

      <p>
        Sometimes I also use brighter colors, like Cerulean, Yellow
        Ocher, and Pyrrole Red, but I don't pull them out until the
        end of a painting, where I might need a strong accent.

      <h3>I Launched a Website</h3>
      <p>
        I set up a website for sharing my paintings and programming
        projects, and for posting technical information about visual
        art and art history.
