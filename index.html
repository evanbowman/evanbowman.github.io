I make the distinction of chromatic blue, because in one sense, color is contextual, and if you key a picture orange enough, even faint cool grays will look bluish. But pure, saturated blues rarely show up in old paintings, primarily due to a lack of inexpensive, chemically stable blue pigments. </p> <p> I do not mean to suggest that pre-industrial era painters did not have access to blue paint, much to the contrary; a wide array of blue pigments existed throughout the seventeenth century, and even hundreds of year earlier. Going back all the way to the fourteenth century, painters often used pigments such as Azurite and Smalt, the former of which, features notably in the background tone the exceptionally well preserved portrait, below, by Hans Holbein the Younger: </p> <img src=img/blog/lady_with_a_squirrel.jpg class=post-image-large> <p class=label>Lady with a Squirrel, Hans Holbein, c. 1526-8</p> <p> But, sadly, Azurite tends to turn greenish over time, and can even start to blacken. Even the well preserved <i>Lady with a Squirrel</i> would have appeared as much more of a purer blue when freshly painted. And some of the other pigments and dyes available at the time, such as Smalt and Indigo, exhibit far less chemical stability than azurite. Smalt fades to a faintly bluish gray over time, and indigo fades to the point of being undiscernible. </p> <p> Only one acceptably stable blue existed prior to 1704; Ultramarine. A gorgeous pigment, but highly scarce, and therefore, highly expensive. Lack of 16th century equivalents of Consumer Price Indices, as well as spotty data, and no real published exchange rates, render calculation of 1600s era materials in todays dollars difficult. But we can still compare the cost of ultramarine to other paints at the time: in early fifteenth century Italy, earth pigments sold for 0.3 baiocchi per ounce, lead white sold for 0.75-0.8 baiocchi per ounce, and Ultramarine for 800 baiocchi per ounce (Hall-Aquitania 2018). Due to issues of cost and availability, well-funded artists tended to use Ultramarine primarily for religious paintings, although Johannes Vermeer, notably, seemed to use the pigment quite friviously, at least compared to his contemporaries. </p> <img src=img/blog/milkmaid-closeup.jpg class=post-image-large> <p class=label>Ultramarine in a closeup of <i>The Milkmaid</i>, Jan Vermeer, c. 1660</p> <p> Everything changed in the year 1704, when a chemist known as Diesbach discoverred a vivid, chemically stable blue paint, completely by accident. In fact, so irregular was the chemical makeup of Diesbach's new blue, that even Diesbach himself, had very little understanding of the chemical structure of the pigment. </p> <p> Diesbach never published any scientific papers recounting the story of how he discoverred what would later become known as Prussian blue, preferring to keep methods for producing the profitable new pigment a closely-guarded secret. The earliest description of Diesbach's serendipitous discovery, appears in a book by German chemist Georg Ernst Van Stahl, twenty five years later. According to Stahl, Diesbach shared lab space with an alchemist by the name Dippel, where Dippel was preparing a distillation of animal blood, which he then mixed with potash. Diesbach, a colorist engaged in the production of a red pigment called Florentine lake, also needed potash for his own experiments, but had run out. He borrowed some of Dippel's, which happened to be contaminated with hexacyanoferrate, and produced a vivid blue precipitate when added to his own dye, rather than the expected red lake (Kraft 2008). </p> <p> While Diesbach had intended to keep the preparation of Prussian blue secret, four years later, in 1708, another chemist in Berlin, Johann Frisch, claimed in a letter that he had reproduced the color better than its inventor, and made the production process more efficient. Frisch seemed to have worked out an arrangement with Diesbach, though, where Diesbach would manufacture the pigment, and Frisch would take responsibility for selling the new color to artists. As the first synthetic pigment, and as the first cheap permanent blue, the paint spread like wildfire; the French painter Watteau adopted the new blue as early as 1710. Some historical evidence suggests that, unable to keep up with demand, German chemists began passing off indigo as Prussian blue (Kraft 2008). By the 1720s, chemists across Europe were producing prussian blue, which became the dominant blue paint for at least one hundred years. Everyone, from American artist Winslow Homer, to Japanese printmakers, to Vincent Van Gogh, now used Prussian blue as their primary source of blue pigment. </p> <img src=img/blog/summer_squall.jpg class=post-image-large> <p class=label>Summer Squall, Winslow Homer, c. 1904</p> <p> Today, Pthalocyanine Blue and synthetic ultramarine seem to have almost completely displaced Prussian blue. I, personally, feel that this is a shame, as Prussian blue is a beautiful color. I do not know how best to articulate my feelings toward prussian blue, except to say, that of all blues, prussian blue has the greatest personality. Used in full strength, prussian blue appears as a blue-black with an irridescent purplish gloss, even when dry, but shifts increasingly toward a moody sea blue-green when tinted with white. I used to believe, that cobalt must be the greatest blue, being the most chromatically unbiased. But over time, cobalt blue just seems incredibly boring to me. Pthalo blue matches Prussian blue in hue, but Pthalo blue is disgustingly saturated. Ultramarine mixes great violets, but generally poor greens, although you can mix greens with ultramarine and chromatic yellows, I do not like yellow paint, and do not use it. I prefer to be able to stick with yellow ocher as my primary yellow paint, which mixes exceptional greens with Prussian blue. Prussian blue also mixes clean violets with (permanent) Alizarin Crimson, whose cool smokey transparency compliments Prussian blue well. Finally, prussian blue exhibits a huge value range in gouache&#8212;I cannot exaggerate the importance of this&#8212;gouache has a narrow value range, making strong dark paints incredibly useful. </p> <br> <p> <b>References:</b> <br> (1) ON THE DISCOVERY AND HISTORY OF PRUSSIAN BLUE, Alexander Kraft, Gesimat GmbH, Berlin.

Freud's colors appear to consist mostly of earth tones, as one would expect. The top left of the palette holds a large mound of black paint, surrounded by what appear to be an earth red and some umbers. The bright muted yellow (center) might be naples yellow. The green (top/middle) looks very much like viridian. </p> <p> Lucian Freud's inclusion of a bright chromatic yellow, amongst his somber earth tones, certainly surprised me. Initially, I thought that the yellow paint may have been included for some specific purpose, for example, the mustard yellow wallpaper in the associated double portrait, "And the Bridegroom". But upon searching for images of Freud in his studio, the yellow also appears on his palette when the artist is working on a portrait with no yellow accents to speak of. </p> <p> I took one more photo of Freud's palette from an oblique angle, because I wanted to make note of the thickness of the paint in the mixing area of the palette&#8212;about a third of an inch thick! </p> <img src=img/blog/freud_palette_mixing_area.jpg class=post-image-large> <p class=label>Palette from "And the Bridegroom", close-up, Lucien Freud, 2001</p> <div><u class=load-comments id=9></u><div class=comments></div></div><div class=separator></div><span class=date>November 13 2019 </span><h3><a class=title-link href=post_8.html>Impressions of Turner Watercolor Show at Mystic Seaport Museum</a></h3><img src=img/blog/turner_artist_and_his_admirers.jpg class=post-image-large> <p class=label>The Artist and his Admirers, 1827</p> <p class=paragraph-1> Last weekend I drove out to Mystic Connecticut to see a collection of JMW Turner's watercolors at the Seaport Museum, on loan from the Tate Britian. Turner, a child prodigy who completed tens of thousands of works on paper over the course of his lifetime, seems remembered mostly for his oil paintings. And I suppose unsurprisingly&#8212;the artist, largely unconcerned with posterity, favored fugitive red and yellow lake pigments, leading conservators to store away his fleeting watercolors in the darker backrooms of museums. The show at the Seaport Museum offers more of Turner's work than I have ever seen in one place. </p> <p> The curators helpfully arranged the collection chronologically, so you can see the progression of the painter's work. Quality varies widely from picture to picture; some of the watercolor sketches are overworked, overly detailed, and washed out. You could argue that, sure, the artist never intended the preparatory works for public consumption, but neither did he intend for the abstract painterly color studies for public display. And the latter are enchanting. </p> <p> While some Turner's more detailed sketches in pure watercolor underwhelm, particularly the ones from early in the artist's career, others stand out as truly exceptional. In <i>San Giorgio - Early Morning</i> (below), Turner perfectly captures the esscence of unbroken water, suffused with light, smooth as glass. </p> <img src=img/blog/san_giorgio_maggiore_early_morning.jpg class=post-image-large> <p class=label>Venice: San Giorgio - Early Morning, 1819</p> <p> Moving into the later work, the painter's watercolors trend further toward absraction, drawn with increasing confidence and fewer details. Without the descriptions, one does not always immediately recognize the subject, as Turner is more interested in recording color, light, and gesture than specific details about the subject. </p> <img src=img/blog/turner_a_shipwreck_at_sea.jpg class=post-image-large> <p class=label>A Shipwreck in a Stormy Sea, c.1823-26</p> <p> The real stars of the show may be a number of tiny gouache and bodycolor works from Turner's sketchbooks, many of which he worked up in translucent to opaque layers on mottled blue paper. The work <i>Dinant, Bouvignes and Cr&#233;vecoeur: Sunset</i> (below) anticipates impressionism in a sense, with warm tones of the rocks in pure vermillion, the warm light on the limestone cliffs pushed towards a spectral yellow-orange, and the shadows cooled down to blue-violet tones. At a distance (or when squinting) the picture resolves into a realistic, albeit colorful, representation of the subject. </p> <img src=img/blog/turner_dinant_bouvignes_and_crevecoeur_sunset.jpg class=post-image-large> <p class=label>Dinant, Bouvignes and Cr&#233;vecoeur: Sunset, c.1839</p> <p> I took notes while walking through the gallery and later, I may publish a list of some of the highlights of the exhibit. For now, the show runs until February, and I would not want to spoil all the surprises, so go see for yourself if you live nearby. </p> <div><u class=load-comments id=8></u><div class=comments></div></div><div class=separator></div><span class=date>June 28 2019 </span><h3><a class=title-link href=post_1.html>I Launched a Website</a></h3><p class=paragraph-1> I set up a website for sharing my projects, and sharing information about subjects that I am interested in. </p> <div><u class=load-comments id=1></u><div class=comments></div></div><div class=separator></div> </div> </div> <!-- <script src="js/blogcomment.js"></script> --> </html>
