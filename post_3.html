I've provided a curated list of below, of some of the books that have taught me the most about painting. While the painters covered in my book recommendations were highly virtuosic, whether they are all great Artists is subject to ongoing debate. But even in the case of John Sargent's more frivolous work, one can still learn a lot of about color and composition. </p> <div class=trifold> <img class=trifold-content src=img/blog/tc_watercolor_book.png> <img class=trifold-content src=img/blog/jss_1908-1913.png> <img class=trifold-content src=img/blog/rembrandt_late_works.png> <img class=trifold-content src=img/blog/velazquez_complete_works.png> <img class=trifold-content src=img/blog/beauty_in_the_city.png> <img class=trifold-content src=img/blog/franz_kline.png> </div> <p> Images, left to right, top to bottom: <b>1)</b> <i>Treavor Chamberlain, a personal view</i>, ISBN: 0-7153-0845-9, <b>2)</b> <i>John Singer Sargent, Figures and Landscapes</i>, 1908-1913.

Covers John Sargent's work during a five year period, after he had given up formal portraiture. When I first saw Sargent's full-length portraits, I was blown away by how skillfull they were. Overtime the luster has worn off for me, and my favorite of Sargent's work are his non-commissioned work, when he was painting his favorite places and people. </p> <p> <i>Rembrandt, the Late Works</i>. Rembrandt, during his late period, when his paintings were the thickest and most textural. Includes <i>Self Portrait with two Circles</i>, <i>The Jewish Bride</i> etc. Some of these paintings are so perfect I wonder if I'm wasting my time with painting, Rembrandt set the bar really high. </p> <p> <i>Velazquez. The Complete Works</i>. Every painting by Spanish golden-age painter Diego Velazquez. This large-format book probably weighs twenty pounds. </p> <p> <i>Beauty In the City, The Ashcan School</i> focuses on New York City painters from the early 1900s, such as George Bellows, Robert Henri, and John Sloan. Of all the books in this list, <i>Beauty In the City</i> is nearest to an Art History book and furthest from a picture book. </p> <p> <i>Franz Kline</i>. Kline has always been my favorite abstract expressionist. </p> <div><u class=load-comments id=3></u><div class=comments></div></div><div class=separator></div> </div> </div> <script src=js/blogcomment.js></script> </html>
