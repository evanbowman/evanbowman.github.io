While a bit intense in oil paint, prussian blue gouache has a softer, grayer tone, and, in my opinion, a special synergy with the colors of the northeast Atlantic coastal region of the United States, where I live. Various sources on the web identify prussian blue as marginally lightfast, in other words; the paint may fade when exposed to harsh light. The paint manufaturer reports the prussian blue pigment as perfectly stable in gouache under normal lighting conditions, so I ultimately placed my trust with Winsor and Newton, ignoring warnings from other artists. Over time, one learns to take the recommendations of artists with a grain of salt; if you ask ten artists for their opinion on something, expect to get twenty different answers. </p> <p> Imagine my surprise when I discovered, after leaving a gouache sketch on my sundrenched dining room table for a week (partially covered by a stack of papers), that the light had completely bleached the blue tones out of the exposed region of the painting. Nevertheless, I remembered reading, years ago, about some conclusions from a scientific paper, where the authors had restored faded prussian blue by keeping the paint in a dark room for an extended time. So I tossed my sketch in a dark closet, and forgot about it. </p> <p> At the end of the summer, I went into my coat closet to get a jacket, collected my forgotten sketch, and found that the paint had recovered all of its lost saturation. Pictures below, before and after leaving the painting in a dark room. </p> <p> Overall, prussian blue permanence seems acceptable, although you would want to keep a painting out of direct sunlight, and give the paint an opportunity to rest in the darkness if damaged by light. </p> <img src=img/blog/pb_sun_bleached.jpg class=post-image-large> <p class=label>Fragment of gouache sketch, sun bleached edge</p> <img src=img/blog/pb_restored.jpg class=post-image-large> <p class=label>Fragment of gouache sketch, color restored after two months of total darkness</p> <div><u class=load-comments id=10></u><div class=comments></div></div><div class=separator></div><span class=date>February 29 2020 </span><h3><a class=title-link href=post_9.html>Lucian Freud's Palette</a></h3><img src=img/blog/freud_palette.jpg class=post-image-large> <p class=label>Palette from "And the Bridegroom", Lucien Freud, 2001</p> <p class=paragraph-1> I saw Freud's palette on display at the MFA Boston, included in an exhibition of forty of the artist's self portraits. Freud's colors appear to consist mostly of earth tones, as one would expect. The top left of the palette holds a large mound of black paint, surrounded by what appear to be an earth red and some umbers. The bright muted yellow (center) might be naples yellow. The green (top/middle) looks very much like viridian. </p> <p> Lucian Freud's inclusion of a bright chromatic yellow, amongst his somber earth tones, certainly surprised me. Initially, I thought that the yellow paint may have been included for some specific purpose, for example, the mustard yellow wallpaper in the associated double portrait, "And the Bridegroom". But upon searching for images of Freud in his studio, the yellow also appears on his palette when the artist is working on a portrait with no yellow accents to speak of. </p> <p> I took one more photo of Freud's palette from an oblique angle, because I wanted to make note of the thickness of the paint in the mixing area of the palette&#8212;about a third of an inch thick! </p> <img src=img/blog/freud_palette_mixing_area.jpg class=post-image-large> <p class=label>Palette from "And the Bridegroom", close-up, Lucien Freud, 2001</p> <div><u class=load-comments id=9></u><div class=comments></div></div><div class=separator></div><span class=date>November 13 2019 </span><h3><a class=title-link href=post_8.html>Impressions of Turner Watercolor Show at Mystic Seaport Museum</a></h3><img src=img/blog/turner_artist_and_his_admirers.jpg class=post-image-large> <p class=label>The Artist and his Admirers, 1827</p> <p class=paragraph-1> Last weekend I drove out to Mystic Connecticut to see a collection of JMW Turner's watercolors at the Seaport Museum, on loan from the Tate Britian. Turner, a child prodigy who completed tens of thousands of works on paper over the course of his lifetime, seems remembered mostly for his oil paintings. And I suppose unsurprisingly&#8212;the artist, largely unconcerned with posterity, favored fugitive red and yellow lake pigments, leading conservators to store away his fleeting watercolors in the darker backrooms of museums. The show at the Seaport Museum offers more of Turner's work than I have ever seen in one place. </p> <p> The curators helpfully arranged the collection chronologically, so you can see the progression of the painter's work. Quality varies widely from picture to picture; some of the watercolor sketches are overworked, overly detailed, and washed out. You could argue that, sure, the artist never intended the preparatory works for public consumption, but neither did he intend for the abstract painterly color studies for public display. And the latter are enchanting. </p> <p> While some Turner's more detailed sketches in pure watercolor underwhelm, particularly the ones from early in the artist's career, others stand out as truly exceptional. In <i>San Giorgio - Early Morning</i> (below), Turner perfectly captures the esscence of unbroken water, suffused with light, smooth as glass. </p> <img src=img/blog/san_giorgio_maggiore_early_morning.jpg class=post-image-large> <p class=label>Venice: San Giorgio - Early Morning, 1819</p> <p> Moving into the later work, the painter's watercolors trend further toward absraction, drawn with increasing confidence and fewer details. Without the descriptions, one does not always immediately recognize the subject, as Turner is more interested in recording color, light, and gesture than specific details about the subject. </p> <img src=img/blog/turner_a_shipwreck_at_sea.jpg class=post-image-large> <p class=label>A Shipwreck in a Stormy Sea, c.1823-26</p> <p> The real stars of the show may be a number of tiny gouache and bodycolor works from Turner's sketchbooks, many of which he worked up in translucent to opaque layers on mottled blue paper. The work <i>Dinant, Bouvignes and Cr&#233;vecoeur: Sunset</i> (below) anticipates impressionism in a sense, with warm tones of the rocks in pure vermillion, the warm light on the limestone cliffs pushed towards a spectral yellow-orange, and the shadows cooled down to blue-violet tones. At a distance (or when squinting) the picture resolves into a realistic, albeit colorful, representation of the subject. </p> <img src=img/blog/turner_dinant_bouvignes_and_crevecoeur_sunset.jpg class=post-image-large> <p class=label>Dinant, Bouvignes and Cr&#233;vecoeur: Sunset, c.1839</p> <p> I took notes while walking through the gallery and later, I may publish a list of some of the highlights of the exhibit. For now, the show runs until February, and I would not want to spoil all the surprises, so go see for yourself if you live nearby. </p> <div><u class=load-comments id=8></u><div class=comments></div></div><div class=separator></div><span class=date>June 28 2019 </span><h3><a class=title-link href=post_1.html>I Launched a Website</a></h3><p class=paragraph-1> I set up a website for sharing my projects, and for sharing information about subjects that I am interested in.
