After the first half hour, we took a five minute break, and, upon resuming, one of the other artists complained that the model had "changed the angle of her head." I looked down at my sketch, a study in gouache, and confirmed that, yes, she had raised her chin a few degrees. But I've been turning this exchange over in my head for a few months, and now, I think that small movements in the model are probably essential. </p> <p> When one takes issue with subtle movement in a live subject, it begs the following question: are you painting a portrait, or a still life of a person? </p> <p> Of course, the sitter for a portrait should make an effort to assume a roughly constant pose throughout. But, at the same time, a subject's movements and conversation can give the artist information necessary to capture the essential character of the subject. Allowing the sitter to move a bit and talk, aside from being a less contrived way to produce a painting, can result in a more animated, or at least more interesting, portrait. Many prominent figures in the history of portrait painting, from John Sargent to Lucian Freud, were known to chat with the subjects of their paintings during the process. </p> <p> I'm going to close with a painting by Anne Gale, whose models must have moved, at least somewhat, while the artist worked. </p> <img src=img/blog/ann_gale_rachelwblue.jpg class=post-image-large> <div><u class=load-comments id=6></u><div class=comments></div></div><div class=separator></div> </div> </div> <script src=js/blogcomment.js></script> </html>
